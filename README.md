# VexRobotics-ENGR-120
This is the code for the group project component of ENGR 120. It was developed outside of version control. The purpose of this repository is to provide a reference for the work completed.

The robot detected an IR symbol, moved toward the signal while avoiding obstacles, picked up a predefined object, and then moved that object to a safe area and put it down.

A video of the robot in action can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2lCNBdH5gM

Additional group members included Thomas Mastromonaco.
